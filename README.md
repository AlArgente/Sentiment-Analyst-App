# Sentiment Analyst App

This repository has the files of my Final Degree Project. In this project I created a RestAPI using Flask as framework. With this app, a data scientist can train models without using it's local machine (once the code is deployed on a server), and he will only have to upload the data. 

Once the user has uploaded the data, he will have to choose the preprocessing that he will use, being able to choose between multiple options, such as tokenize, stemming, or deleting stopwords. After that the user will have to choose the model he wants to use (right now the two options are Na√Øve Bayes and SVM). Once it's finished, the user can use the model directly from the app, or downloading it to his local machine.

This application will facilitate the work of data scientists.
